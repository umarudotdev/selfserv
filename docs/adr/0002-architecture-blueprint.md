# ADR 0002: Comprehensive Architectural Blueprint

## Status

Proposed

## Context

A detailed narrative blueprint describing the architectural pillars (event-driven poll loop, stateful connection management, RAII resource safety, configâ€‘driven routing, streaming parsers for HTTP, multipart, and CGI) was authored. We need to formalize which elements are part of the committed baseline versus future enhancements, and represent key flows visually for maintainers.

## Decision

Adopt the described event-driven, single-threaded poll() architecture with explicit per-connection state machines and layered parsers as the canonical baseline. Defer some advanced behaviors (full CGI, streaming multipart to disk, full error taxonomy) to staged milestones.

## Architecture Overview (Visual Summary)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph EV[Event Loop]
    P[poll()] --> D{dispatch}
  end
  L[Listening Sockets] -->|accept| CC[ClientConnection]
  D --> RCV[Readable?]
  D --> SND[Writable?]
  RCV --> PARSE[HTTP Parser]
  PARSE -->|headers done| ROUTE[Router]
  ROUTE --> HANDLERS{Handler}
  HANDLERS --> STATIC[Static File]
  HANDLERS --> DIR[Dir Listing]
  HANDLERS --> UPLOAD[Upload / Multipart]
  HANDLERS --> CGI[CGI Exec]
  STATIC --> RESP
  DIR --> RESP
  UPLOAD --> RESP
  CGI --> RESP
  RESP[Build Response] --> BUF[Write Buffer]
  SND --> BUF --> SEND[send() slices]
  subgraph TIMEOUTS
    CC --> TM[Deadline Calc]
    TM --> P
  end
```

## Connection State Machine (Current & Future States)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> ACCEPTED
  ACCEPTED --> REQ_HEADERS : POLLIN data
  REQ_HEADERS --> REQ_BODY : need body (CL / chunked)
  REQ_HEADERS --> HANDLE : no body
  REQ_HEADERS --> TIMEOUT_408 : header deadline
  REQ_BODY --> HANDLE : body complete
  REQ_BODY --> TIMEOUT_408 : body deadline
  HANDLE --> RESP_BUILD
  RESP_BUILD --> SENDING
  SENDING --> KEEPALIVE_IDLE : Connection: keep-alive
  SENDING --> CLOSING : close
  KEEPALIVE_IDLE --> ACCEPTED : next pipelined request
  KEEPALIVE_IDLE --> IDLE_CLOSE : idle deadline
  TIMEOUT_408 --> SENDING
  IDLE_CLOSE --> CLOSING
  CLOSING --> [*]

  state HANDLE {
    [*] --> ROUTE_MATCH
    ROUTE_MATCH --> STATIC_OK
    ROUTE_MATCH --> DIR_LIST
    ROUTE_MATCH --> UPLOAD_PROC
    ROUTE_MATCH --> CGI_EXEC
    CGI_EXEC --> CGI_STREAM
    CGI_STREAM --> RESP_BUILD
    UPLOAD_PROC --> RESP_BUILD
    DIR_LIST --> RESP_BUILD
    STATIC_OK --> RESP_BUILD
  }
```

## RAII Resource Wrappers

Current: `FD` (dup-on-copy, close in dtor). Future: add NonCopyFD (move-like semantics emulated) for uniqueness-critical pipes & CGI FDs.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class FD {
    -int fd_
    +FD()
    +FD(int)
    +FD(const FD&)
    +operator=(const FD&)
    +reset(int)
    +release() int
    +get() int
    +valid() bool
    -closeIfValid()
  }
```

## Parsing Layers

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Conn as ClientConnection
  participant HTTP as HttpRequestParser
  participant MP as MultipartParser (future streaming)
  participant CGI as CGIHandler
  loop event loop
    Conn->>HTTP: append new bytes
    HTTP-->>Conn: status (incomplete/complete)
    alt multipart body
      Conn->>MP: feed chunk
      MP-->>Conn: part events / file write
    end
    alt CGI request
      Conn->>CGI: spawn & pipe mgmt
      CGI-->>Conn: stdout chunks
    end
  end
```

## Staging & Milestones

| Milestone | Scope                                                                        | Exit Criteria                                             |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| M1        | Core poll loop, basic HTTP, static files, keep-alive, timeouts               | Pass manual curl/browser tests; no leaks under valgrind   |
| M2        | Robust request parser (chunked), directory listing, DELETE, uploads (raw)    | All existing tests + new parser unit tests green          |
| M3        | Streaming multipart parser to disk                                           | Large file upload (>10MB) without OOM; integrity verified |
| M4        | CGI execution (blocking isolation via fork + pipes), response header parsing | Dynamic script returns 200/302 reliably                   |
| M5        | Enhanced routing: virtual hosts, error pages, redirects                      | Config test matrix passes                                 |
| M6        | Hardened security: canonical path, traversal prevention, size limits         | Security test suite passes                                |

## Rationale

The blueprint balances simplicity (single thread, poll) with correctness (state machines, RAII) and extensibility (layered handlers). Deferring CGI & streaming multipart reduces early complexity while establishing invariant-rich foundations.

## Consequences

- Positive: Predictable resource use, ease of reasoning, minimal synchronization complexity.
- Neutral: Single core utilization (acceptable for pedagogy / scope).
- Negative: Requires meticulous state bookkeeping; potential latency variance due to poll granularity (mitigated by dynamic timeout selection).

## Notes

This ADR supersedes ad-hoc architectural descriptions; future ADRs must reference this when altering event loop, connection lifecycle, or parser layering.
